```

### Network Details:

- **Base Sepolia (Testnet)**: Chain ID `84532`

---

# 🧪 **Testing Smart Contracts**

Run Foundry tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test
forge test -vvv # Verbose output
```

---

# 🚀 **Deploy Contracts**

### Step 1: Set Up Chainlink VRF Subscription

1. Visit https://vrf.chain.link
2. Create a subscription on Base Mainnet
3. Fund with LINK tokens
4. Copy subscription ID
5. Update `contracts/script/DeployTriviaGameV2.s.sol` with your subscription ID

### Step 2: Deploy TriviaGameV2

```bash
cd contracts

# Deploy to Base Mainnet
forge script script/DeployTriviaGameV2.s.sol:DeployTriviaGameV2 \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  --broadcast --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $BASESCAN_API_KEY

# Or deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet)
forge script script/DeployTriviaGameV2.s.sol:DeployTriviaGameV2 \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org \
  --broadcast --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $BASESCAN_API_KEY
```

### Step 3: Add Contract as VRF Consumer

Go to https://vrf.chain.link and add your deployed contract address as a consumer.

### Step 4: Fund Contract with ETH

```bash
cast send YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --value 0.5ether \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Step 5: Add Questions

```bash
forge script script/AddBasicQuestions.s.sol \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  --broadcast
```

Copy contract addresses → `/frontend/src/config/contracts.ts`.

---

# 🖥 **Run Frontend Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

View at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# 🌐 **Deploy Frontend**

Deploy using **Vercel**:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Add environment variables on Vercel.

---

# 📄 **Smart Contract Events**

The contracts emit events for tracking game progress:

### TriviaGameV2 Events

```solidity
event PlayerRegistered(address indexed player, string username);
event GameStarted(address indexed player, uint256 sessionId, uint256 requestId);
event QuestionsAssigned(address indexed player, uint256 sessionId, uint256[] questionIds);
event GameCompleted(address indexed player, uint256 sessionId, uint256 score, uint8 correctCount, uint256 reward);
event RewardClaimed(address indexed player, uint256 amount);
event LeaderboardUpdated(address indexed player, uint256 newRank, uint256 totalScore);
```

---

# 🧭 **Gameplay Logic**

### 1. User connects Web3 wallet

ETH balance fetched in real time.

### 2. User registers username

One-time registration, stored on-chain.

### 3. User starts game

Transaction triggers Chainlink VRF request for random questions.

### 4. VRF assigns random questions

Chainlink VRF callback selects 10 random questions from contract storage.

### 5. User plays trivia

10 multiple-choice questions with 5-minute time limit.

### 6. User submits answers

Smart contract calculates:
- Correct answer count
- Speed bonus (faster = more bonus)
- Total score
- ETH reward amount

### 7. Leaderboard updates

Player's rank updates automatically based on total score.

### 8. User claims rewards

ETH rewards transferred instantly to player's wallet.

### 9. Weekly rewards (optional)

Top 10 players share weekly reward pool.

---

* Question timer with visual countdown
* Progress tracking
* Real-time balance updates
* Toast notifications for transactions

* **Top 100 players** by total score
* Player username
* Total score (includes correct answers + speed bonuses)
* Games played
* Best score in a single session
* Accuracy percentage
* Real-time rank updates

Weekly rewards:
* Top 10 players share weekly reward pool
* Distribution: 40%, 25%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.5%, 0.5%

## 🔒 **Smart Contract Security**

- Reentrancy protection with OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
- Access control with `Ownable`
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Secure random number generation using Chainlink VRF
- Emergency withdrawal functions for admin
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 🔐 **Input Sanitization**

The application implements comprehensive input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks. The following measures are in place:

### Sanitization Utilities

- `sanitizeString(input: string)`: Removes HTML/JS tags and escapes special characters
- `sanitizeUsername(username: string)`: Sanitizes usernames with strict character whitelisting
- `sanitizeNumber(input: unknown)`: Safely converts input to a number with proper error handling
- `sanitizeAddress(address: string)`: Validates and sanitizes Ethereum addresses

### Form Handling

The `useSanitizedForm` hook wraps react-hook-form with automatic input sanitization:

```typescript
import { useSanitizedForm } from '@/hooks/useSanitizedForm';
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(3).max(20),
  // other fields...
});

const form = useSanitizedForm(schema, {
  // optional react-hook-form options
});
```

### Validation

Input validation is handled by Zod schemas with built-in sanitization:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { sanitizeUsername } from '@/utils/sanitize';

export const usernameSchema = z
  .string()
  .min(3)
  .max(20)
  .transform(val => sanitizeUsername(val.trim()));
```

### Testing

All sanitization functions have corresponding unit tests in `src/utils/__tests__/sanitize.test.ts`.

---

# 🛡 **Security Notes**

* **Reentrancy Protection**: All contracts use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
* **Access Control**: Admin functions protected with `onlyOwner` modifier
* **Input validation**: Alphanumeric + underscore only
* **Time limits**: 5-minute timeout per game session
* **Gas optimization**: Efficient storage patterns and loops
* **No price manipulation**: Rewards are fixed in ETH, not dependent on oracle prices

---

# 🎥 **Demo Video Instructions**

Your demo video should include:

1. Opening the webapp in browser
2. Connecting Web3 wallet (MetaMask/Coinbase Wallet)
3. Registering username
4. Starting a game session
5. Showing Chainlink VRF question assignment
6. Playing trivia (answering questions)
7. Submitting answers and viewing score
8. Claiming ETH rewards
9. Viewing leaderboard position
10. Showing transaction on BaseScan
11. Explaining the architecture and Base integration

---

# 🏆 **Why This Project Stands Out**

* **Built on Base**: Fast, cheap L2 transactions
* **Chainlink VRF Integration**: Provably fair randomness
* **Real ETH rewards**: Instant payouts on-chain
* **No entry fees**: Free to play, earn based on performance
* **Comprehensive leaderboard**: Competitive gameplay with weekly rewards
* **Production-ready**: Full error handling, state management, and testing
* **Fully on-chain**: No backend dependencies
* **Modern Web3 stack**: Wagmi, Viem, AppKit for seamless wallet integration
* **Clean architecture**: Well-documented and maintainable code
